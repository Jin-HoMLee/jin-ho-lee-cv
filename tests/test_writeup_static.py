"""Static-HTML guard for the Phase 15 splice-neoepitope write-up (issue #128).

AI crawlers do not execute JavaScript, so every crawler-critical string of the
article - title, section headings, the amplifier disclaimer, each figure's
static fallback, the Article JSON-LD, and the CV cross-link - must be in the
server-rendered HTML. Skip-guarded locally (needs a web build); the CI
`web-guard` job and `just web-guard` build web/dist first.
